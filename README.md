 Currently, we have the following features:
 - Making all font on a page dylexic friendly :D 
 - Change all the font on a page to something more readable
 - Adds alt tags or better alt tags to images on page

Right now, BetterBrowse is NOT on the Google Extension store. 
The best way to get it on your computer is to download this repository! 

1. Make sure to "Extract all" after you download if it shows as a zip.

2. Then go to your Google Chrome browser and and on the top right corner, there should be a puzzle piece. Select this and go to "Manage Extensions". This should open an Extensions tab. 

3. In the top right, there should be a toggle that says "Developer Mode". Select this and few buttons should appear under the Google Logo. 

4. Select "Load Package" and select the download.

5. You should be good to go now!
